# Profile-management
My name is Selva Kumar, and I am excited to share with you my recent project, a website for managing user profiles. I was able to complete this project within 48 hours, even though I had limited experience with web development.

To access my website, please follow these steps:

1.Install MySQL Server
2.Install XAMPP
3.Install MongoDB
4.Configure MySQL and XAMPP by referring to online tutorials or videos
5.Create a database named "profile_management" and a table named "login" in MySQL
6.Create a database named "database" and a table named "info" in MongoDB
7.Run MySQL server
8.Save the "profile_management" folder as "pm" in the "htdocs" directory of XAMPP
9.Open any web browser and type "localhost/pm" in the address bar (Please ensure that you have set up MySQL and MongoDB properly to access the website's full features)

That's it! You can now explore my work and provide me with your valuable feedback.

Thank you for your time and interest in my project.
